One way we do that is by exploring the many unique Italian cuisines that have sprung up all over the world, outside the (physical and/or mental) boundaries of Italy. This year, we are excited to highlight 11 Italianate regions from around the world.\n\n##### In our Global Italian series, on the last Saturday and Sunday of every month, we will offer an imaginative 5 course set menu in place of our unusual menu. Alongside region-specific guest chefs and collaborators, join us on a trip through 11 regions over 4 continents. Each dinner will also feature new cocktails and drink pairings inspired by the history and culture of the area.\n\n##### Check out **[this month's menu](/menu/global%20italian%20no.%201:%20chicago/ \"this month's menu\")** or get more details [on IG: **@cafemarsbk**!](https://www.instagram.com/cafemarsbk/?hl=en \"@cafemarsbk\")\n\n##### Reservations now available on **[OpenTable](https://www.opentable.com/r/cafe-mars-brooklyn \"OpenTable\")**!\n",
