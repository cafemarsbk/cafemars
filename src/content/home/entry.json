For the 3rd year in a row, we will close it out with an entire week of special services. Our version of the Feast is a 7-course, family-style (ish!) tasting menu, consisting of 12 different servings with 20+ products of the sea!  To tie a bow on and celebrate our year, each of the dishes will be pulled from one of 2025’s  Global Italian regions, including 2024’s Tropical Italian dinners. \n\n###### We hope you will join us December 17-21 in celebrating the holidays with indulgent seafood, festive vibes, and perhaps a seasonal beverage pairing?! It’s the perfect night out for friends and family looking for an unusual take on an age-old Italian tradition.\n\n###### [Check out the** menu**](https://cafemarsbk.com/menu/feast%20of%20the%20seven%20fishes/ \"menu\") or get more details [on IG: **@cafemarsbk**!](https://www.instagram.com/cafemarsbk/?hl=en \"@cafemarsbk\")\n\n###### [Reservations now available on **OpenTable**](https://www.opentable.com/booking/experiences-availability?rid=1278811\\&restref=1278811\\&experienceId=598476\\&utm_source=external\\&utm_medium=referral\\&utm_campaign=shared\\&covers=2\\&dateTime=2025-12-17T18:00:00 \"OpenTable\")!\n",
